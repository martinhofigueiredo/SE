<li>The response time analysis doesnt variate from the prioritization mode or forces the rate to be monotonic</li>

<h1 id="online-scheduling-with-dynamic-priorities">Online scheduling with dynamic priorities</h1>
<p>The schedule is being <strong>built</strong> while it works so it maintains an otptimum order.</p>
<h1 id="pros">Pros</h1>
<ul>
<li>Easily Scalable
<ul>
<li>since it considers everytime in runtime it can deal with a bigger amount of task</li>
<li>this property makes it able to deal with sporadic tasks</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="cons">Cons</h1>
<ul>
<li>Harder to implement than cyclic
<ul>
<li>this needs to be constantly updating so theres a compute power loss since the scheduler needs some cycle itseld to run</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="dynamic-priorities">Dynamic priorities</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>EDF</strong> Earliest Deadline first
<ul>
<li>Inversely proprotional to the time of the deadline</li>
<li>optimal with respect to dynamic priorities criteria</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>LSF</strong> Least Slack First or <strong>LLF</strong> Least Laxity First
<ul>
<li>Inversely proportional to slack or laxity rsad %t%</li>
<li>optimal with respect to dynamic priorities criteria</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>FCFS</strong> First Come First Serve
<ul>
<li>doesnt need preemption because it will always do the task by order of request</li>
</ul></li>
