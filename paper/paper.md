# Introduction
 The system we developed is intend to be used as a small digital clock with a few minigames. This serves as an example of a IoT device capable of displaying some up to date information like the weather and having some interative features that need a realtime response as for the minigames.


# Methods

We tried to structure the code for the functions we wanted to develop in a "apps" a  class object that has a `setup` method that handles all the configuration of the microcontroller and a `routine` method that has to be iterated on to update the app.

To choose which app is running we added a button to cycle trough a app list and change which app is running at a time. There is never more than one app running at one time.

The timing of each function was done using the `micro()` to timestamp the begin and end of the function and the value presented here was calculated as the last result of a rolling average after 10000 cycles.

The memory usage of our programs takes into account the assets needed to run the applications and the binary that compiled and uploaded

# Games

## Alien Attack
- This game uses two buttons to move a spaceship side ways on the screen in order to hit enemys.

## Bounce Ball
- This game uses two buttons to move platform side ways on the screen in order to catch and return the ball to break the block on the top of the screen.
