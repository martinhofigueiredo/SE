# Introduction
 The system we developed is intend to be used as a small digital clock with a few minigames. This serves as an example of a IoT device capable of displaying some up to date information like the weather.

# Methods

We tried to structure the code for the functions we wanted to develop in a "apps" a  class object that has a `setup` method that handles all the configuration of the microcontroller and a `routine` method that is the iterated on to update the app.

These were then placed on freeRTOS task scheduler which was controlled firstly in a round-robin to make sure every task was sucesseful run at least once so we could time it

To get the timing results of each task we used the freeRTOS timing API to return the value of
